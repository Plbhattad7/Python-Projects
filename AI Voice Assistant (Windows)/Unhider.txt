If you have hidden you r file and you want to unhide it then you need to know this condition:

1. You have to remember the folder's name
2. You should know where the path was i.e you should know where it was saved.

Once you know the folder name then you have to open cmd or powershell and type this command. 
We will take your folder's name as <path/folder-name>

Command: attrib -s -h /d "<path/folder-name>"

To avoid parameter errors remeber these conditions:

1. Your folder's name should be in double quotes.

2. For example my Folder's name is : Secret. And I have saved it on Desktop. Then my command will be:

Command: attrib -s -h /d "C:\Users\USER NAME\Desktop\Secret"

Thankyou. This is the way it will work.
